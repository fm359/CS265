     It may have bombed in inTable

1.3  a) bug1.c does not compile. Fixed by passing pointer to 'n' instead of value in scanf
     b) bug2.c does not compile. Fixed by swapping '%d' and '%f'

        bug3.c:79. : numlines is incremented before the first assignment
        Fixed by changing to increment after assignment
     d) avg.c does not compile. Fixed by passing pointer to 'n' instead of value in scanf
     e) Program requires a randomized pivot location so that it does not return an array with empty first element             (seg fault). Fixed by asserting that pivot location has changed.

1.4  The compiler can only detect syntax errors

1.5  If the compare functions are type specific, the compiler will give an error
     If the compare functions are not type specific, their will be a runtime error
